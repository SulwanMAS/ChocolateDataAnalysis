The dataset that I took was from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/chocolate-sales which is the basic premise of the project that I have made.

# Chocolate Sales Data Analysis

# Context of Project

A mid-sized Chocolate manufacturer is currently experiencing a couple of problems mainly about unpredictable inventory management where it frequently overstocks, declining customer retention and they have discovered that their marketing spending is ineffective.

As a Business Analyst that was employed by the company, they have asked a few questions that you are tasked to answer which is :

1. What are the Key sales trends by product, region and season?
2. Which customer segments are the most or least valuable?
3. How can we forecast demand to optimize production?

We will be answering the first question and that is :

# Key Findings
